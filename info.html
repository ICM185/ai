    <p class="info-paragraph">In an era where biodiversity is increasingly threatened by human activities, understanding and identifying wildlife is essential for conservation efforts. This project aims to develop an AI-powered wildlife animal identifier that leverages advanced image recognition technology to facilitate the identification of various animal species. By utilising machine learning algorithms, the system will analyse and classify images of wildlife, providing users with instant and accurate identifications.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="info-paragraph">The project uses the image recognition model provided by Teachable Machine, which was trained on multiple sets of data on animal recognition and fine tuned to identify animals. The site is coded with HTML and basic javascript.</p>
